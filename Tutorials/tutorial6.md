# Tutorial 6 - Writing Our Own ArrayList

## Step 1 - Start with the template code.

Divide into groups and take a look at the code you've already been given.

**Note that because this is a list of ints, some of the things ArrayList can do with objects don't quite work**

## Step 2 

We will walk through some common ground together about how the system will behave.

## Step 3

Your group will be assigned one of the methods to implement. Work together and with me to create an implementation.

## Step 4

You will push your code and let me know which group memeber's repo to find it in. 

## Step 5

We will combine our efforts and see if we've produced a workable solution to a dynamic list of ints.
